# Fire-Detection
In this project, we developed a real-time fire detection system using OpenCV tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).
Leveraging my expertise in computer vision and real-time processing, we implemented an algorithm capable of detecting fire
in various environments with high accuracy. The system uses video feed from the UAV, and applies advanced image processing
techniques to identify potential fire outbreaks. Custom training datasets were annotated to enhance detection precision, achieving
confidence scores between 0.78 and 0.92.
